README: PDFdecoder, June 2024. 

The PDFdecoder project is a set of Python analysis modules which produce
the main results of arXiv: 2312.02278; the code is developed by the authors
of that study, Brandon Kriesten and T.J. Hobbs. Questions should be referred
to bkriesten@anl.gov and/or tim@anl.gov.

The currently released package includes ingredients for the two model
architectures discussed most extensively in the paper --- the autoencoder
with constrained latent (AE-CL) and variational autoencoder inverse
mapper (VAIM), each of which resides in a dedicated subdirectory, ae_cl/
and vaim/, respectively. Inside each directory is a jupyter-notebook,
`..._demo.ipynb' which illustrates basic aspects of the analysis. Given
the large file sizes, we do not include training data (in input_data/),
but users can generate this information themselves; it is also available
on request. The ae_cl/ and vaim/ subdirectories also contain Python
scripts defining the model architectures, activation functions, and related
[hyper]parameters (e.g., ae_cl.py), performing training (train.py),
and constructing a statistical ensemble (ensemble.py).

Additionally, utils/pdf_gen.py is a script for randomly sampling and
generating training distributions based on integrable analytic forms,
and can be modified directly as needed.
